## Project Q&A

### What is this all about?

A large number of people recognize the importance of,
and dedicate their efforts to moving the needle
on humanity's largest problems.
Unfortunately, very few of them have life circumstances
that allow them to really fullfill that potential.
Most are forced into painful tradeoffs, in which preventing
their day-to-day reality from falling apart often takes
precedence over saving the world.

Existing communities that could support and accomodate
such people have reliably formed around major cities,
in which the high cost of living makes the problem even worse.
Those who choose to live outside of the major hubs have more
time and flexibility,
but lack intellectual peers and social support
-- which turn out to be critical for success.

The Accelerator Project aims to provide a low-cost environment,
in which high-potential individuals can become more stable,
productive, networked, and more capable of sustained
and directed progress towards improving the world.
A part of it is simply about solving the coordination problem
-- it makes more sense for a group of 50 people to live
in a low cost country than for a single person to do the same.
Another part is about building and optimizing a culture,
in which effectively taking action to solve important problems
is as obvious and natural as breathing.

### What, exactly, will you offer?

A 3-6 month stay in the Accelerator,
during which residents can focus exclusively on developing
the foundations to make progress on the things they think
are most important,
while doing object level work in order to have
feedback loops and build good habits.

Removal of many of life's trivial inconveniences.
Social, emotional, and self-improvement support networks.
Giving mentorship in the form of
[legitimate peripheral participation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimate_peripheral_participation)
in a
[community of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice).
Contact with others on the same path,
and long-term individual mentorship.

### How to get involved?

If you'd like to help push the project forward, please take the
[survey](https://goo.gl/pc4wAT) and youâ€™ll be added to the Facebook chat.
Until May 2017, the project is in freeform exploration/discussion mode.
Our current target for move-in early 2018 (still subject to change).

There will be an initial week-long meeting of the founding team
in the United Kingdom from May 20th to 27th
(the recruitment process will open soon).

### Why do you think the project will succeed?

We already have significant funding (mostly from Eric and other people
interested in being part of the founding team), and we are learning
from the best
-- drawing on our connections to the [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/)
community, the
[Center for Applied Rationality](http://rationality.org/) and others.
At the same time, we are careful to integrate people with a wide
spectrum of backgrounds and expertise,
and also keep in mind the need for everyone to be healthy,
happy and complete human beings
-- which (we hope) will let us avoid most of the common pitfalls.
